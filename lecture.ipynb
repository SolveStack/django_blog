    "Based off of Solvestack community feedback, there was interest in building portfolio web apps.  This lecture uses code from the book __Django 3 By Example__ written by _Antonio Mele_.  We will go over how to start creating a blog application.  This will allow us to strengthen concepts we're applying to Solvestack while giving others a chance to learn ways to build out their portfolio.  This is a quick, useful project that they could push to their own website.\n",

    "# Additional ORM concepts\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "Models are subclasses of `django.db.models.Model`, which means they follow a certain format we can use to easily manage data\n",
    "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/\n",
    "- Django looks through the `models.py` files and creates tables for each model it finds in there\n",
    "- Django uses this to create the API we have used to query databases in past lectures (`python manage.py shell`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post model\n",
    "### Fields\n",
    "This is defined in the `blog/models.py` file.  Additional information on fields can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The fields we have are:\n",
    "- `title` Used for blog title posts\n",
    "- `slug` This field is used to create unique seo-friendly URLs for blog posts\n",
    "> `unique_for_date` is used so that URLs are built with the `slug` and `publish` date\n",
    "- `author` is a many-to-one relationship.  Each post can only be written by one user, but a user can write any number of posts.\n",
    "> `on_delete` parameter tells Django what to do in the db when an object is deleted.  `CASCADE` will create a behavior here where if a user is deleted, the db will also delete all related posts by them. For more information on this, see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete\n",
    "- `body` Body text of the post\n",
    "- `publish` Uses Django's timezone `now` is used.  It's like Python's datetime.now method, but it's timezone aware.\n",
    "- `created` This is the time the post was created.  `auto_now_add` saves the date automatically\n",
    "- `updated` The last time the post updated\n",
    "- `status` Uses the `choices` parameter to limit choices\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating this model, it is activated by adding it to the list of `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and apply migrations, we use `makemigrations`.  In this project, we ran `python manage.py makemigrations blog`, followed by `python mnaage.py migrate`.  You will see files created in the `migrations` folder from this.\n",
    "> If you want to see the SQL being generated for this migration, run `python manage.py sqlmigrate blog 0001`.  This shows the SQL that was generated by `makemigrations` before `migrate` was run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick review - querysets\n",
    "A QuerySet is a collection of database queries to retrieve objects from your database. You can apply filters to QuerySets to narrow down the query results based on given parameters.\n",
    "- We can test these in Django's shell with `python manage.py shell` once in the shell:\n",

    "### Custom managers\n",
    "We made a custom manager to retrieve posts that have a `published` status.\n",
    "- You can add extra manager methods to a manager that already exists\n",
    "- You can also create a new manager by modifying a QuerySet that the manager returns\n",
