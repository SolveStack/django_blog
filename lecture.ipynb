    "- `author` is a many-to-one relationship.  Each post can only be written by one user, but a user can write any number of posts.\n",
    "> `on_delete` parameter tells Django what to do in the db when an object is deleted.  `CASCADE` will create a behavior here where if a user is deleted, the db will also delete all related posts by them. For more information on this, see: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete\n",
    "- `body` Body text of the post\n",
    "- `publish` Uses Django's timezone `now` is used.  It's like Python's datetime.now method, but it's timezone aware.\n",
    "- `created` This is the time the post was created.  `auto_now_add` saves the date automatically\n",

    "- You can add extra manager methods to an existing manager, or create a new manager by modifying the initial QuerySet that the manager returns\n",
    "- The first manager declared in a model becomes the default manager. You can use the Meta attribute default_manager_name to specify a different default manager. If no manager is defined in the model, Django automatically creates the objects default manager for it. If you declare any managers for your model but you want to keep the objects manager as well, you have to add it explicitly to your model\n",
